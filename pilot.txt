The following text fades in over black:

This is a true story. The events depicted took place in
Minnesota in 2006. At the request of the survivors, the
names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the
rest has been told exactly as it occurred.

                                          FLARE TO WHITE:

EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY. RURAL MINNESOTA - DAY

The white becomes snowfall, a blizzard. Through it we can
make out a two lane road. A car emerges from the snow --
rust-spotted, chains on the tires -- coming towards us.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. CAR (TRAVELING) - DAY

LORNE MALVO, age unknown, birth place unknown, sits behind
the wheel, his breath white with frost. If he minds he
doesn’t show it.

As he drives we become aware of THUMPING coming from inside
the trunk. As if someone is in there who doesn’t want to be.
Malvo ignores it.

A DEER

appears in the road ahead of him. Malvo turns too late, HITS
it. The CAR SKIDS off the road, ROLLS twice -- the trunk
popping open -- before coming to rest on its wheels.

Beat. A MAN emerges from the trunk wearing only underwear.
He is stunned from the crash, but sound enough of mind to
know this is his chance. As we watch he LOPES off through
waist-deep snow, making for the tree line.

Beat. The driver’s door opens. Slowly, Malvo climbs out.
His head is bleeding where it hit the windshield. He stands
unsteadily in the snow, getting his bearings.

ANGLE ON THE OTHER MAN

Loping off through the snow. Malvo could catch him if he
tried, but he makes no attempt. Instead he walks into the
center of the road where the deer lays on its side,
struggling to get up. Three of its four legs are broken, but
still it fights for life. Malvo stands over the wounded
animal, looking down.
                                                            2.


CLOSE UP ON THE DEER

It’s eyes wild, blood bubbles foaming from its nose and
mouth, mortally wounded.

CLOSE UP ON MALVO

Studying it’s eyes.    What does he see in there?

We begin to hear a strange throbbing, churning sound, half
animal, half machine.

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN. NYGAARD HOUSE. SAINT CLOUD, MINNESOTA - DAY

LESTER NYGAARD, 40, home for lunch, sits at the kitchen
table. Lester is the kind of guy who apologizes when you
step on his foot. His wife, PEARL, 39, is heating up a can
of soup at the stove. We get the sense she has been talking
nonstop since Lester walked in the door.

                    PEARL
          -- Saturday. I said we’d bring a
          Jello salad, but Kitty said
          meatloaf, so --

The surging, churning sound is louder now, coming from under
the floor. Nygaard listens to it, both fascinated and
slightly disturbed.

                       PEARL (CONT’D)
                 (exasperated)
          Hon?

                    LESTER NYGAARD
              (snaps out of it)
          What’s that, hon?

Pearl brings the pot over, ladles tomato soup into his bowl.

                    PEARL
              (exasperated)
          I said it’s Scotty’s birthday
          Saturday. We’re supposed ta be at
          your brother’s at one. With
          meatloaf.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
              (beat, listening)
          It sounds different today, don’t ya
          think? Angry.
                                                          3.


                      PEARL
            I’m washing towels.   That’s the
            towel sound.

She sits.   They eat.

                      PEARL (CONT’D)
            Kitty says they just got one of
            those fancy European all in ones.
            Says it washes and dries. One
            machine. Can you believe that?

                      LESTER NYGAARD
            I bet that set them back a penny.

                      PEARL
            He can afford it, your brother.
            Kitty said he just got a big
            promotion. After only working
            there a year.

We can tell his brother is a touchy subject for Lester.

                      PEARL (CONT’D)
            Kitty said they got one of those
            new surround-sound systems too.
                (Lester eats)
            Guess I married the wrong Nygaard.
            That’s what I said. We had a good
            laugh.

                      LESTER NYGAARD
            It’s just slow now. At the shop.

                     PEARL
            Oh, hon. That’s what you always
            say. Slow.

Beat.   They eat. Lester wipes his mouth, stands.

                      LESTER NYGAARD
            Well, better get back to it.

                      PEARL
            You make your own wins. That’s
            what Kitty said Ron told her.
            Salesmen make their own wins. You
            gotta try harder, hon. Smile, for
            Pete sake. Maybe wear a nicer tie.

                      LESTER NYGAARD
                (looks down)
            You gave me this tie.
                                                           4.


                    PEARL
          Well, if you were a better
          salesman, I’da bought you a nicer
          tie.

The sound of the washing machine takes on a new urgency.

                    PEARL (CONT’D)
          At least take a look. I keep
          thinking maybe it’s the settings.
          Kitty said Ron fixes things around
          the house all the time. Says he
          took the toaster apart over the
          weekend. Good as new now. Browns
          to beat the band.

Lester’s jaw is tight.   He opens the door to the basement.

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT. NYGAARD HOUSE - DAY

Lester stands at the bottom of the stairs. The washing
machine is acting like a caged animal, roaring and bucking.
Lester stares at it, hypnotized. We get the sense he’s
looking at his own trapped heart.

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. INSURANCE AGENCY. SAINT CLOUD, MINNESOTA - DAY

Lester Nygaard sits across from a YOUNG COUPLE.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          So, that’s -- like I said, there’s
          two kinds of policies you should be
          thinking about. You got your Whole
          Life and your Whole Life Plus.
          Which is -- has all the benefits of
          Whole Life -- plus a heck of a lot
          more.

                    YOUNG MAN
          We just came in to get Charline on
          my health care.

                    YOUNG WOMAN
          On account of I’m having a baby.

                    YOUNG MAN
          Ya. A boy we’re hoping.

                    YOUNG WOMAN
          Or a little girl.
                                                  5.


                    YOUNG MAN
          But definitely one or the other.

                    YOUNG WOMAN
          Ya. I’d just about hug the pants
          off a little girl.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          Oh ya? Even more reason to -- all
          the more --

He digs through his desk, pulls out a brochure.

                    LESTER NYGAARD (CONT’D)
          -- because, I mean, what happens if
          you have an accident at your job?

                    YOUNG MAN
          I work at the library.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          Well, what if you’re in a car crash
          and you go out the windshield? Or
          say you’re on a ladder cleaning out
          the gutters and fall off the darn
          thing and break your neck. These
          things happen every day. People
          fall asleep smoking in bed and burn
          ta death. What I’m saying is the
          morgue is full of guys thought they
          didn’t need life insurance.

The young couple stares at him, horrified.

                    LESTER NYGAARD (CONT’D)
              (losing steam)
          -- for peace of mind, I’m saying.
          To know that your little boy --

                     YOUNG MAN
          Or girl.

                   LESTER NYGAARD
          Right. Or little girl is taken
          care of.

                    YOUNG WOMAN
              (beat, creeped out)
          We’re supposed to be at my mom’s by
          four.

                    YOUNG MAN
          Ya, so we’re gonna --
                                                           6.


They stand, head for the door.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          Oh. Okay, well -- at least let me
          give you a brochure. Or I got
          these nifty pens. Look at that.
          Black and red ink. You just click
          the -- Okay, well, come on back if
          you --

The couple exits.   Nygaard sits for a moment.

                    LESTER NYGAARD (CONT’D)
          Well, heck.

                                                    CUT TO:

EXT. APPLIANCE SHOP. SAINT CLOUD, MINNESOTA - DAY

Lester stands outside the store, staring in through the plate
glass window at a brand new washer dryer set. He’s wearing a
puffy orange coat and a wool hat with ear flaps.

An SUV pulls up down the block. SAM HESS, 40, climbs out
with his TWIN SONS, MICKEY and MOE, 15. Hess is a big guy,
intimidating. His boys look like two identical blocking
sleds.

                    SAM HESS
              (to the driver)
          Circle for a bit. I’m gonna feed
          the boys.

The SUV pulls away.   Hess and sons walk towards Lester.

                    MOE
          Dad said I could get pie for lunch.

                    MICKEY
              (snickers)
          Ya. Hair pie.

Sam WACKS Mickey in the back of the head. Moe cracks up.
Oblivious, Lester stares at the washer dryer. Walking by,
Hess recognizes him.

                    SAM HESS
              (stopping)
          Will ya look at that. It’s Lester
          Niggered.

Lester turns, sees Hess. It takes a moment for him to
recognize him, but when he does he looks nervous.
                                        7.


          LESTER NYGAARD
Come on now, Sam. It’s -- well,
it’s Nygaard. Same as in high
school.

          MICKEY
You went to high school with Lester
Niggered, dad?

          MOE
Ya, dad, did you --

            SAM HESS
Shut up.    How you been, Lester?

          LESTER NYGAARD
Oh, can’t complain.

          SAM HESS
You look like a damn pumpkin. You
turn into a pumpkin at midnight?
You got stepsisters?

          MICKEY
Stepsisters were evil, dad.      They
weren’t fairies.
 
            SAM HESS
Shutup.

            LESTER NYGAARD
Um, uh.    You look good, Sam.

          SAM HESS
Why wouldn’t I? Got my own
trucking company now. Hess and
Sons. These are the sons. God help
me.

          MICKEY
Yeah, we’re the ...

          SAM HESS
Shutup. Got rigs all over the
Great Lakes.
    (to his sons)
Hey, you remember I told you the
story of the boy I put in the oil
drum and rolled onto the highway?

          MICKEY
Is that him, dad?
                                                         8.


                     MOE
          Ya, dad.   Is that him?

                    SAM HESS
          Oh you betcha. Good old Lester
          pencil dick. Say, Lester. What
          was the name of that girl you went
          with in high school? The curvy
          one?

                       LESTER NYGAARD
          Pearl.

                       SAM HESS
          Ya, Pearl.     What a rack on that
          girl.

                    MOE
              (to Mickey)
          Dad’s saying she had big titties.

                    MICKEY
          I know what rack means, ya fairy.

Hess smacks both boys in the back of the head.

                       MICKEY (CONT’D)
          Ow.

                    MOE
          Ya, dad. Ow.

                    SAM HESS
              (to Lester)
          You know she gave me a tug once.
          Homecoming, senior year. Had these
          nice fat hands. Real soft. Let me
          feel up her tits while she did it.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          We’re married now. Going on
          eighteen years.

Sam is taken off guard by this.     The kids crack up.

                     MICKEY
          Oh, dad.   That’s embarrassing.

                    MOE
          Ya, dad. Super embarrassing.

Hess’s eyes narrow. His face is burning and he doesn’t like
the feeling.
                                                  9.


                     SAM HESS
          Eighteen years, huh? That’s
          something.
              (beat)
          Never knew what she saw in you,
          really.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          Oh, well --

                    SAM HESS
          I mean, help me out.    No looks. Or
          brains. Or money.

Lester can tell he’s in danger.

                      LESTER NYGAARD
          Ya. Well.    I should get back to it.

But Hess moves in front of Lester.

                    SAM HESS
          A little guy like you.

                    MICKEY
          He’s real small dad.

                    MOE
          A real pee wee.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          Ha. Ya. Real good seeing you, Sam.
          Real good. And meeting your boys.

But Hess won’t let him go

                    SAM HESS
              (to his sons)
          Did I ever tell you how I used to
          beat this little guy up in high
          school? I’d write my name on my
          fist in Sharpie fore I punched him,
          so everyone would know who did it.

                    MICKEY
          That’s a good one, dad.

                      MOE
          Ya, dad.    A real good one.

Hess lifts his fist, shows Lester.

                      SAM HESS
          Remember?
                                                        10.


                     LESTER NYGAARD
          Ha. Ya.    That was -- a long time
          ago.

Slowly, Hess moves his fist right in front of Lester’s face,
enjoying his fear. Lester stands there, humiliated, not
knowing what to do. Hating his helplessness, his base
cowardice.

Then Hess drops his fist and smiles to show it’s all just a
big joke. Lester starts to relax. Then HESS FAKES A PUNCH.
Lester panics, turns and RUNS FACE FIRST into the PLATE GLASS
WINDOW of the appliance store -- CRACK! He falls to the
ground, lays on his back.

                       MICKEY
          Geez, dad.     His face is pretty
          messed up.

                     MOE
          Ya, dad.   It’s real messed up.

CLOSE UP OF LESTER’S FACE

As he lays there, his nose broken and bleeding, staring up at
the sky. Beat. We PULL OUT and discover we are now in ...

INT. WAITING ROOM. HOSPITAL. SAINT CLOUD, MN - DAY

Lester, now sitting, lifts an ice pack to his nose. He is on
a bench in the emergency room. And just as we realize this,
we see that sitting next to him is LORNE MALVO, a nasty
bruise and cut on his forehead from the car crash.

Lester lowers the ice pack.    Beat.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          What a day.
              (to a passing nurse)
          Excuse me, miss. Do ya think --
          will it be much longer? This thing
          hurts like the dickens.

                    NURSE
          We’ll call your name.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          Ya, but I been here an hour
          already.

                    NURSE
          We’ll call your name.
                                                            11.


She walks away.    Lester opens a soda, tries to drink, but it
hurts too much.    He puts the soda down.

                     MALVO
           Could I have a sip?

Lester turns.     Malvo is looking at him.

                     LESTER NYGAARD
           Heck, take the whole can. I can’t
           drink the darn thing without a
           straw.

He hands Malvo the soda. Malvo tips it back and drains it.
Lester tries not to stare at Malvo’s head injury.

                     MALVO
           Obliged.
               (puts down the can)
           What happened to your nose?

                     LESTER NYGAARD
           Oh, well. That was just -- a
           misunderstanding.

                     MALVO
           Is that you misunderstanding the
           other fella, or him
           misunderstanding you?

                       LESTER NYGAARD
           Pardon?

                     MALVO
           Who misunderstood whom?

                     LESTER NYGAARD
           No. What I’m saying is -- it’s not
           good to dwell on these things.

                       MALVO
           Why?

                       LESTER NYGAARD
           Pardon?

                     MALVO
           Why is not good to dwell on things?
           Especially things that put you in
           the hospital.

Beat.   Lester doesn’t know what to say.     Malvo watches him.
                                      12.


          LESTER NYGAARD
It was -- I was outnumbered if you
wanna know the truth. Three to
one. Big guys too. Well, one of
them. The other two were just
kids. But big fer their age.
    (beat, getting worked up)
Ya know -- if I was any kind of man
-- I’da shown that Sam what’s what.

          MALVO
Sam?

          LESTER NYGAARD
Hess. He was a bully in high
school and he’s a bully now.

          MALVO
So why didn’t you?
    (off Lester)
Show him what’s what.

          LESTER NYGAARD
Well, his, uh, he had his sons with
him, and --

          MALVO
So you let a man beat you in front
of his children. To send them a
message.

          LESTER NYGAARD
No.  That’s not --
    (frustrated)
Heck. Just -- heck.

          MALVO
In my experience, you let a man
break your nose, next time he’ll
try to break your spine.

          LESTER NYGAARD
Sam? No way. I mean, I don’t think.
It’s just -- I guess I embarrassed
him in front of his boys.

          MALVO
You embarrassed him.

          LESTER NYGAARD
By -- he was telling me about a
time when he and my wife -- see,
they --

                    LESTER NYGAARD (CONT'D)
          -- but he didn’t know she was my
          wife, is the thing. And when I
          told him --

                    MALVO
          A man slept with your wife, and
          you’re worried you embarrassed him.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          Not slept with -- they didn’t -- he
          said it was just -- she has soft
          hands, see? -- and I --

                    MALVO
          Mister, we’re not friends. Maybe
          one day we will be. But I gotta
          say, if that was me -- in your
          position -- I woulda killed that
          man.

                       LESTER NYGAARD
          Well, now.     Hold on.

                    MALVO
          You said he bullied you in high
          school?

                    LESTER NYGAARD
              (reluctantly)
          Four years. Gave me an ulcer.
              (humiliated)
          One time he put me in an oil barrel
          and rolled me in the road.

                     MALVO
          Seriously?
              (Lester nods)
          And now he tells you he had
          relations with your wife. Then
          bullies you again in front of his
          children. Friend, this is not a
          man who deserves to draw breath.

Beat. All the humiliation and pain Lester has suffered
threatens to bubble up.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          Ya. Okay. But here’s the thing --

                     MALVO
          No.   That is the thing.
                                                        14.


                     LESTER NYGAARD
              (beat)
          Well -- heck -- I mean, okay.
          Okay. But what am I supposed ta do?
              (beat)
          Heck, you’re so sure about it,
          maybe you should just kill him for
          me.

                     MALVO
              (beat)
          Are you asking me to kill this man?

                      LESTER NYGAARD
          No.    That was -- I was joking.

The nurse walks up.

                    NURSE
          Mr. Nygaard.

Lester looks at Malvo.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          Ya, that’s -- just a second.
              (to Malvo)
          We’re just two fellas talking,
          right? Just blowing off steam?

Malvo studies him.

                    NURSE
          Sir, it’s real busy --

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          Ya, like I said -- just a second.

                       MALVO
          Sam. Hess.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          No. Now wait just a second --
          that’s not --

                       NURSE
          Sir!

But Lester is focused on Malvo, like a mouse hypnotised by a
snake.

                       MALVO
          One word.     Yes. Or no.
                                                        15.


Lester looks at him, feeling a strange tickle down his spine.
All he has to do is say no, but he doesn’t.

                    NURSE
          Sir, I’m gonna give your spot to --

                    LESTER NYGAARD
              (stands)
          Ya, I’m -- I’m coming for Pete
          sake.

He shares one last moment of eye contact with Malvo, then
grabs his coat and hat, follows the nurse to an exam room.
Malvo watches him go.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY. SAINT CLOUD, MN - DAY

The site of Malvo’s accident. The car is still there, its
trunk now closed. TWO POLICE CARS are parked nearby, lights
flashing. DEPUTY MOLLY SOLVERSON, 29 stands behind the
wreck, kicking her feet to stay warm.

A THIRD CAR pulls up. Police Chief VERN THURMAN (40s) gets
out. Molly comes over to greet him.

                    MOLLY
          Cold enough for ya, chief?

                     VERN
          Supposed to get down to negative
          ten later.

                    MOLLY
          Heard that. Don’t much like the
          sound of negative.

                     VERN
          Thought I might strip down to my
          shorts. Work on my tan.
              (nods)
          So what’s this here then?

Molly shows him the scene.

                    MOLLY
          Chief, I arrived on the scene at
          thirteen hundred hours, found this
          late model Ford. Looks like she
          rolled a few times. I found a set
          of footprints leading away from the
          car.

                    MOLLY (CONT'D)
          Possible our driver, injured, got
          confused, wandered into the woods.
          I was about to investigate.

Vern circles the car, crouches at the front grill.

                    VERN
          Blood here. Hair too.

                    MOLLY
          Saw that. I was thinkin’ maybe a
          deer, but couldn’t find the
          evidence.

Vern walks out into the road, looking for something. Fresh
snow covers everything. Vern does some mental calculations,
picks a spot and kicks the snow away.

                    VERN
          Here it is.

Molly looks down, sees the underlayer of snow is pink with
blood.

                    MOLLY
          Son of a gun.

Vern walks back to the car.   The driver’s door is open.

                    VERN
              (leans in)
          Windshield’s cracked. Blood there
          too. Driver musta hit his head

                    MOLLY
          Or her head.

Vern hears something, straightens.   It comes again louder.
THUMPING. From the trunk.

                    VERN
          You check the trunk?

                     MOLLY
          No, sir.

The thumping continues.    Vern and Molly approach the trunk.

ANGLE ON THE TRUNK

Something is inside, banging.
                                                          17.


VERN

Thinks about opening it, the pros and cons.

                     MOLLY (CONT’D)
           Should I unholster my sidearm?

                     VERN
           Not unless you think there’s a
           ninja inside.

He reaches down and pops the trunk.     It swings open,
revealing:

THE DEER

Still alive, flailing weakly.

VERN AND MOLLY

Look at the deer.

                     MOLLY
           Huh.

Vern takes out his gun, puts the deer out of its misery. They
stand for a moment in silence, breath misty.

                      MOLLY (CONT’D)
               (beat)
           So -- wanna take a look at those
           footprints then?

                     VERN
           Sounds good.

          nursery.

                     MOLLY
              (beat, walking)
          Can’t believe I missed that deer in
          the trunk.

                    VERN
          Don’t be. I been doin this a long
          time. Never checked for a deer in
          the trunk. (Beat) Or any wildlife.

Molly sees something.

                       MOLLY
          Chief.

He looks where her flashlight is pointed. There, sitting in
the snow, is A MAN IN HIS UNDERWEAR, frozen to death.

              (beat)
          Okay.

Vern goes into the

BEDROOM

Takes off his holster, locks his gun in the safe. Heading
back to the kitchen, Vern stops outside the BABY’S ROOM. All
the furniture -- crib, changing table, etc -- has been pushed
to the center. We see a tarp, paint trays and clean rollers
on the floor.

INT. HESS TRUCKING COMPANY. SAINT CLOUD, MINNESOTA - DAY

A large garage housing a raised DISPATCH OFFICE. Through the
office window we see Sam talking to BRUCE GOLD (40s). Gold is
Sam’s lawyer. TWO BIG GUYS sit with them.

In the main garage there is a big rig parked along the far
wall. The logo on the trailer reads NARCOL. Sam Hess’s
truck is parked next to it.

Boxes of INFLATABLE WOMEN are stacked against the wall.
Mickey and Moe have one of them open. Mickey is using a high
pressure air hose to fill up one of the women. She gets
fatter and fatter, then explodes. They crack up.

                    MOE
          Dad said we should take turns.

                    MICKEY
          Dad told me he thinks you’re
          retarded.

Moe attacks him. They wrestle. Mickey gets Moe in a
headlock. Lorne Malvo enters the garage, watches them.

                     MALVO
          You’re doing it wrong. You wanna
          press your forearm against the back
          of his neck, then grab your elbow
          with the other hand. Choke him
          right out.

The two boys separate, unsettled.

                    MICKEY
          Whatcha want, mister?

                    MOE
          Ya, mister. Whatcha want?

                    MALVO
          Sign outside says Hess and Sons.

Malvo studies them, Tweedle Dum and Dumber.

                    MALVO (CONT’D)
          Which is the older boy?

                    MICKEY
          Me. Mickey. So that means I’m in
          charge when dad’s gone.

                      MOE
          Are not.    Mom said --

                    MICKEY
          Mom’s got nothing ta do with it,
          faggot.

Upstairs, Sam sees his boys talking to Malvo, comes out of
the office.

                    SAM HESS
          Help you with something?

Malvo sizes him up, ignoring the hired muscle.

                      MALVO
          You Hess?

Hess and the two big guys come down the stairs. It’s clear
they don’t like strangers coming around, asking questions.

                    SAM HESS
          Who wants ta know?
                                                         22.


Malvo checks to see if there’s another guy behind him asking
questions.

                      MALVO
          Me.

He nods to the big rig.

                     MALVO (CONT’D)
          See you do work for Narcol.   You
          know Romo?

          Only two reasons to come to my

          truck driver?

Malvo is unintimidated.

INT. FARMDALE MOTEL. SAINT CLOUD, MINNESOTA - NIGHT

The owner, a heavyset WOMAN, is yelling at a sullen TEEN.
Malvo enters.

                    WOMAN
          How many times I gotta tell ya?
          You can’t just take dirty sheets
          offa one bed and put ‘em on
          another. It’s unsanitory.

                    TEEN
          I shake ‘em out first.

                    WOMAN
          You don’t have the sense God gave a
          clam, do you? Go shovel the walk.

The sullen teen exits.

                    MALVO
          I need a room.

                      WOMAN
          Just you?

                      MALVO
          Pardon?

                    WOMAN
          Is it just for you?   The room.

                    MALVO
          What difference does that make?

                    WOMAN
          Different rate for two. And if ya
          got pets -- dog, cat -- that’s an
          extra ten bucks.

                    MALVO
          What about a fish?

                       WOMAN
          Excuse me?

                    MALVO
          Would a fish cost me ten dollars?

                       WOMAN
          Well --

                    MALVO
          Or say I kept spiders. Or mice.
          What if I had bacteria?

                    WOMAN
          Sir, bacteria are not pets.

                       MALVO
          Could be.

                    WOMAN
          Sir, perhaps you’d be happier in a
          different motel.

                    MALVO
          I just want to know the policy.
          I’m a student of institutions.

                    WOMAN

                    MALVO
          Why do you let her talk to you like

                    TEEN
          Aw, she’s not that bad.

                    MALVO
          Son, she compared you to a clam.

The teen thinks about it.   The woman is kind of a bitch.

                    TEEN
          Well, what should I do?

                    MALVO
          Guy insulted me once. I pissed in
          his gas tank. Car never drove
          straight again.

The teen smiles, puts down the shovel. He walks over to the
woman’s car. Malvo lets himself into his room.

Yer sayin’ other than the fact he

Ya. See, we know from the wreck

No head injury.

          fella killed him on account of all
          the blood in her eyes. But we’re

          holdings, automobiles. And --
          well, there’s no delicate way to
          put this -- the will is very clear.
          Your dad decided to leave

          Moe.

                    MALVO
          I know it’s hard to hear. But the
          will is very specific. Quote, I
          leave the entirety of my vast
          estate to my second born -- and
          favorite -- son, Moe. That’s
          sweet. He musta really loved that

Bo walks away. Lester stands there, feeling both terror and

Lester comes over.

          Did you -- geez.

          know, tragic --

                    MALVO

                     LESTER NYGAARD
           No. I just mean -- Aw geez. He had
           a wife. And those boys.

                      MALVO
           He put you in a barrel and rolled
           you in the road. Your problem is,
           you lived your whole life thinking
           there are rules. There aren’t. We
           used to be gorillas. All we ever
           had was what we could take and
           defend. The truth is, you’re more
           of a man today than you were
           yesterday.

           How do ya figure?

                     MALVO
           It’s a red tide, Lester. This life
           of ours. The shit they make us
           eat. Day after day -- the boss,
           the wife, etcetera -- wearin’ us
           down. If you don’t stand up to it -
           - show ‘em you’re still an ape
           deep down where it counts -- you’re
           just gonna get washed away.

Off Lester: this resonates.

           The windshield was cracked. There

                       PEARL
          Well, yah.     So I can picture a real
          man.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          Now that’s not very nice.

                       PEARL
          Loser.

Lester picks up the claw hammer.    He walks towards Pearl.

                    PEARL (CONT’D)
          What are you doon? You gonna hit
          me with a hammer? That’s a laugh.
                                                          53.


The first blow catches her by surprise. The pain of it, the
blood that runs down her face. The moment hangs there. Then
Lester BEATS HER TO DEATH with the hammer. Each blow is a
release. Eventually, he stops. Stands there panting.
Slowly the red haze lifts. He looks down at his blood
spattered clothes.

                       LESTER NYGAARD
            Aw geez.

He is about to panic, when he looks up.

CLOSE UP ON AN INSPIRATIONAL POSTER

taped to a bare concrete wall. On it a school of yellow fish
all face the same direction, except one. The poster reads
There’s Always One. Be the One.

LESTER

Stares at it. As he does, an idea hits him. A brilliant,
dangerous plan. Could he really do it? As we watch, Lester
strips off his clothes, shoves them in a garbage bag.

Carefully Lester wipes the handle of the claw hammer to
remove his finger prints. Over this we hear:

                       LESTER NYGAARD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                (pre-lap, distraught)
            Ya, it’s me. I -- you need ta -- I

Lester, dressed in new clothing, stands with his back to us.
We move towards him as he practices for his phone call.

                       LESTER NYGAARD
            Ya, it’s me. I can’t talk long.
            She’s -- I did something --
                (beat)
            Ya, it’s -- there’s been an
            accident and I --

Beat.    He picks up the phone, dials.

INT. FARMDALE MOTEL. SAINT CLOUD, MN - SAME TIME

Malvo sits on his bed, watching tv. The phone rings, which
is strange, because no one has this number.

          Yes?

          Ya, it’s me -- Lester -- she’s --

                    MALVO
          How did you get this number?

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          What? I was -- I saw you this
          morning on my way ta -- look, I’m
          freakin’ out here -- I don’t know
          what ta do.

                    MALVO
          Lester, have you been a bad boy?

                   LESTER NYGAARD
          Aw geez. I just -- can you come
          over? It’s -- I’m on Willow Creek
          Drive. Number six thirteen.

                    MALVO
              (beat, thinking)
          Sure, Lester. I’ll be right there.

Lester hangs up.    Beat.   He thinks about his next step.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM. NYGAARD HOUSE. SAINT CLOUD, MN - NIGHT

Lester pulls a chair over to the armoire. He climbs up,
roots around on top, pulls down a SHOTGUN. He finds some
shells, loads it. Malvo will be here soon and Lester plans
to kill him and frame him for his wife’s murder.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. FRONT HALLWAY. NYGAARD HOUSE - NIGHT

Lester holds the gun in one hand. Practices opening the door
with the other, raising the gun. It’s too clunky. Plus he
needs to lure Malvo inside the house before he shoots him.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
              (practicing)
          What did you do? You killed her.

                                                          55.


Lester looks around. He decides to hide the shotgun against
the LIVING ROOM WALL, just on the other side of the doorway.

Looking around, Lester loses his nerve a little. But no.     He
has a plan. This will work. He sets the shotgun in its
hiding place, looks around. Has he forgotten anything?

THERE IS A KNOCK ON THE FRONT DOOR

Lester panics, tries to calm down.

                    LESTER NYGAARD (CONT’D)
              (under his breath)
          You killed her. You killed her.

Lester goes to the front door, takes a deep breath, opens it.

VERN THURMAN stands outside.

                    VERN
          Evenin’, Lester.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
              (nervous)
          What -- what do ya want?

                    VERN
          Well, I suppose first I’d like ta
          come in.

Lester looks behind him.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          Uh, ya. Well -- it’s just -- now’s
          not a good --

                    VERN
          Just take a second.

Vern steps forward and Lester, by instinct, steps back.   Now
Vern is in the house. He takes off his gloves and hat.

                    VERN (CONT’D)
          Supposed ta get down to negative
          ten tonight, I hear.

Lester is a mass of nerves.    Vern steps towards the kitchen.

                    VERN (CONT’D)
          Pearl home?

Lester moves to block him, putting his back to the kitchen
doorway.
                                                       56.


                     LESTER NYGAARD
          Uh -- no -- she’s, uh -- at my
          brother’s.

                       VERN
          Okay then.     How’s the nose?

                      LESTER NYGAARD
          Huh?    Oh, hurts.

                    VERN
          How’d that happen anyway?

                     LESTER NYGAARD
          Slipped.   Over at the fire station.

                     VERN
          Ouch.   Go to the hospital?

                      LESTER NYGAARD
          Ya.    They, uh, set it.

                    VERN
          Talk to anyone while you were
          there?

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          What do ya mean?

                    VERN
          Well, the reason I’m here -- not
          sure if ya heard -- but Sam Hess
          got himself killed last night over
          at the Lucky Penny. Nasty business.
          And, well, I heard you were talkin’
          to another fella about Hess before
          he died. Over at the hospital.

                     LESTER NYGAARD
              (pale)
          No. I don’t think --

                    VERN
          What was his name again? The other
          fella?

Lester tries to decide what to say. Then the cuckoo clock
chimes from the living room. 8 o’clock. Lester jumps,
startled.

                     VERN (CONT’D)
          Ya okay there, Lester? Ya seem a
          bit jumpy.
                                                        57.

          Ya, I’m, uh -- it’s just Pearl’s
          gonna be home soon and --

Looking past Lester, Vern sees the basement door is open.   He
notices something on the floor. A BLOODY FOOTPRINT.
Alarmed, Vern DRAWS HIS GUN.

                    VERN
          Lester. Listen to me very
          carefully. I need ya to get down
          on the ground.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          No. Wait. Just -- listen to me --
          it’s not what it --

                    VERN
          Lester. On the ground. Now.

Gun on Lester, Vern backs into the kitchen.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          No. Now hold on. Hold on. Don’t -
          - there’s nothin’ down there --

Vern glances down the basement stairs.

          -- That’s not -- I didn’t do
          nothin’ -- I just got home. I just
          got home and --

CLOSE UP ON VERN

Trying to catch up to events. He keeps the gun on Lester,
reenters the front hall. With his free hand, he keys his
radio handset

                    VERN
          This is Chief Thurman. I’m at six
          one three Willow Creek Drive.
          Requesting --

A SHOTGUN BLAST catches VERN in the BACK, spins him around.

REVEAL: LORNE MALVO holds LESTER’S SHOTGUN. It’s 8 PM, and
Malvo has come in through the back door. He FIRES AGAIN, the
spray catching Vern in the chest and throat. Vern falls.
                                                            58.


                      MALVO
          Any more?

Lester is in shock, white as a sheet.

                      MALVO (CONT’D)
          Lester.    Are there any more cops?

Lester shakes his head.   Malvo kicks Vern’s gun away, looks
down.

ANGLE ON VERN

Eyes wild, like the deer in the opening. He is mortally
wounded, blood bubbles coming out of his mouth as he
struggles for air.

CLOSE UP ON MALVO

Struck by the synchronicity of this.    He studies the dying
man’s eyes.

                    MALVO (CONT’D)
          What did you tell him?

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          Nothing -- I, uh -- he asked about
          Sam.

                    MALVO
          You got any more shells for this?

Lester shakes his head.   Malvo lays the shotgun on the table.

                    MALVO (CONT’D)
          Where’s the basement?

Lester points.    Malvo enters the kitchen, goes down the
stairs.

ANGLE ON LESTER

He pulls two shotgun shells out of his pocket, eyes the
shotgun. How long to grab it and reload?

He reaches out his other hand, then realizes it’s bleeding.
There’s a shotgun pellet buried in the meat of his thumb.
Then Lester becomes aware that his injured hand is now lit by
flashing red and blue lights. Another police car has just
pulled up outside.

Nygaard hears the front door CRASH OPEN upstairs. He is
trapped. He looks around. No exit. Can he hide? No. They’ll
find him. Then his eyes hit the inspirational poster on the
wall. There’s only one way out. Lester, knowing he will be
found at any moment, RUNS towards the wall, his head down.
Crack. He knocks himself out.

          someone in the house, come out with

Nothing. Cautiously, Molly goes room to room, searching. We
know Malvo could still be in the house. Each blind corner
and dark space offers certain death. We can tell Molly is
afraid, out of her league, but she keeps her wits.

Gus picks up the walkie talkie.

Gus hits his siren, pulls out onto the road. We stay with
him as he follows the speeding car, it’s tail lights visible
through the front windshield.

The car in front of him pulls over. Gus pulls in behind it.
Beat. He writes down the license plate number, notes the
time. Then climbs out of the car.

EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY. RURAL MINNESOTA - CONTINUOUS

Gus approaches the driver’s side, flashlight out. The inside
of the car is dark, ominous. We can’t see the driver.

Then the driver’s side window rolls down.    Now we see the
driver is Lorne Malvo.

                    MALVO
          Evening, officer.

                    GUS GRIMLY
          License and registration please.

                    MALVO
          Well, we could do it that way. You
          ask me for my papers and I tell you
          it’s not my car. That I borrowed
          it. And see where things go from
          there. We could do that. Or, you
          could just get back in your car and
          drive away.

                    GUS GRIMLY
          Why would I do that?

                    MALVO
          Because some roads you shouldn’t go
          down. Because maps used to say
          there be dragons here. And now
          they don’t. But that don’t mean
          the dragons aren’t there.

From the prowler, we hear Kurt’s walkie talkie.

                     KURT GRIMLY (O.S.)
          Dad.   Come in, dad. Over.

           happen, Officer Grimly. I’m gonna
           roll up my window. And then I’m
           gonna drive away. And you’re gonna
           go home to your son. And every few
           years you’re gonna look at his face
           and know that you’re alive because
           you chose not to go down a certain
           road on a certain night. Because
           you chose to walk into the light,
           instead of into darkness. Do you
           understand?

                      GUS GRIMLY
           Sir.

                     MALVO
           I’m rolling up my window.

The window rolls up. Gus stands there, knowing he should
pull his gun. That he should order Malvo out of the car, but
something stops him. The feeling the rabbit gets in the
presence of the wolf.

So he stands there as Malvo’s car pulls away.

                      KURT GRIMLY (O.S.)
           Dad.   Come in, dad. Over.

Gus walks back to the car, climbs in, closes the door.   Beat.
He picks up the walkie talkie.

                     GUS GRIMLY
           Dad here. Over.

                      KURT GRIMLY
           Detroit just got a touchdown. Over.
               (beat)
           Dad? Are you there? Over.

Beat.   Gus sits, shaken.

                     GUS GRIMLY
           I hear ya. We’ll get ‘em in the
           fourth. And hey, don’t forget ta do
           yer English homework, okay? I love
           you.
                                                          64.


A long silence.

                    KURT GRIMLY
          Ya didn’t say over. Over.

                    GUS GRIMLY
              (smiles)
          Over and out.

Beat. Gus sits in his warm car, while outside the
temperature drops. Then he picks up his note pad, examines
Malvo’s license plate number.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. LESTER’S HOUSE. SAINT CLOUD, MN - NIGHT

It’s really snowing now. Every police car in town is there,
along with fire trucks and an ambulance. Patrolmen go in and
out of the house. Molly sits on a planter by the front door,
in shock.

Inside the lobby we can see Vern’s body covered with a
blanket. After a moment, Molly gets to her feet and walks
down the driveway.

She passes Vern’s prowler.   Something inside catches her eye.

ANGLE ON TWO CANS OF HOUSE PAINT

In the back seat.

MOLLY

Stands looking in at them, and all they represent.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. VERN’S HOUSE. SAINT CLOUD, MN - NIGHT

Molly’s car pulls up. She gets out, grabs the paint cans,
starts for the house. There are responsibilities she will
take on now, unspoken promises that must be kept.

The front door opens. Ida comes out.   She knows from Molly’s
face that the worst has happened.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM. ST. CLOUD, MN - DAY

Lester is in bed, unconscious. His head is bandaged.     He
looks terrible. Outside, snow falls. He wakes up.
                                                        65.


Gets his bearings. He is in the hospital. Not dead. Better
still, he is not handcuffed to the bed. There are no cops.

Could it be? Could he have gotten away with it? He lifts
his right hand to get some water, sees the BANDAGE.

He examines the spot where the shotgun pellet caught him.   On
his face is a hint of uncertainty.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. ICE. SAINT CLOUD, MN - DAY

Molly’s dad, Lou, unpacks fishing gear from the back of his
Suburban. Molly, in civilian clothes, sits on the tailgate,
looking out at the snow. Her prowler is parked nearby.

                     LOU
           I got two kinds of sandwiches.
           Tuna and turkey.
               (beat, off her)
           Tuna’s for the fish. Unless ya
           think they’d think that’s
           cannibalism.

Molly doesn’t answer.   Lou offloads a cooler.

                     LOU (CONT’D)
           Nice service yesterday, I thought.
           Simple.

Beat.   Molly is lost in thought.

                     LOU (CONT’D)
           Ya know, I been looking for some
           more help at the restaurant.
           Someone to seat customers. Answer
           the phones.

                      MOLLY
               (absently)
           A hostess.

                     LOU
           That what they call it? Anyway,
           not sure if that was somethin’ you
           might be interested in.

                     MOLLY
               (this gets a look)
           I’m a police officer, dad.
                                                          66.


                     LOU
           Well, sure. I know that. I also
           know that people in this world are
           less inclined to shoot a hostess,
           than, say, an officer of the law.

                      MOLLY
               (beat)
           That’s true.

He kicks snow off his boots.

                     LOU
           So, does that mean you’re gonna
           help yer old man out?

                      MOLLY
           No. But maybe you could put that
           in the ad.

Molly jumps down from the tailgate.

                     MOLLY (CONT’D)
           On second thought, I’m gonna head
           in ta work. Coroner’s report should
           be in. Rain check on the fishin’?

He nods.   She kisses his cheek.

                     MOLLY (CONT’D)
           Love ya, dad.

                     LOU
           Love ya too, hon.

Molly walks to her cruiser.    Her father watches as we ...
