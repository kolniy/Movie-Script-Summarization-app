ACT ONE
FADE IN:
INT. WRITERS’ ROOM/LIZ’S OFFICE - MORNING
LIZ enters with shopping bags. Many of the WRITERS look
under the weather. There’s a flu going around.
LIZ
(brightly)
Good morning! How is everyone?
FRANK
I caught that flu. I have a fever,
my feet are swollen and I feel like
my intestines are going to explode.
LIZ
(equally brightly)
Don’t care. Four days ‘til my
beach vacation on St. Bartleby’s.
LUTZ
St. Bartleby’s? Isn’t that the
most politically unstable island in
the Bahamas?
LIZ
That’s the media. No one reports
on dictators who aren’t hanged.
PETE
What is it about that place? Last
year you came back so relaxed
and... pleasant.
LIZ
I have the perfect resort, Pete.
Private beaches, a soft ice cream
machine with a generator so we’re
solid if rebels attack the power
grid, and showing bare feet is
tolerated but not expected.
Liz is lost in dreamy thought.

EXT. BAHAMAS RESORT - LAST YEAR
Perfect Caribbean backdrop. Island music plays. Liz lounges
holding a blue drink in one hand and a butterscotch dipped
soft ice cream in the other. She wears a long robe and her
feet are covered with matching hospital booties.
CUT BACK TO:
INT. WRITERS’ ROOM/LIZ’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Everyone as we left them.
CERIE
Good for you finally cutting loose.
It’ll be just like that movie...
LIZ
“Under the Tuscan Sun”?
CERIE
No, I want to say “Cocoon”?
(re: Liz’s shopping bag)
Ooh. Is that a new bathing suit?
LIZ
Better. It’s designer beachwear
from the St. John collection. This
is called a “tankoort.”
She holds up an aggressively non-sexy beach garment: princess
sleeves and culottes with a skirt.
LUTZ
(re: tankoort tag)
From the Jill St. John collection?
LIZ
Jeez. It’s like you can’t buy
fashion at the CVS anymore.
Liz enters her office and starts “Bosu Balling.”
LIZ (CONT’D)
Leaving Monday. Got to get it
tight. Cerie, I am really excited.30 ROCK 308: "TBD"

CERIE
Go girl. Oh, the Pelican Bay hotel
called and said they’re over-booked
and your reservation is canceled.
(off Liz’s stricken look)
Is that for the same vacation?
CUT TO:
INT. JACK’S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER
JACK is there.
JONATHAN pops his head in.
JONATHAN
Mr. Donaghy, your mother’s nurse is
here. Should I tell her to go
away, we’re busy and things were
perfect before she came along?
JACK
Jonathan, Elisa is my girlfriend.
JONATHAN
(scandalized)
Sir, she’s from the Bronx. The
other assistants are talking. And
you know how cruel they can be.
(bitter)
Especially Andrew.
ELISA enters, dressed for work.
Jack gives her a big hug.
JACK
Hey there, beautiful. I can’t wait
to see you at my place tonight.
ELISA
That’s what I’m here about, Jack.
I like you. But us being together
while I work for your mom has
created an uncomfortable work
environment.
JACK
I know. I never should’ve gotten
her that hydraulic wheelchair.

INT. JACK’S DEN - LAST WEEK
Jack and Elisa are having an intimate moment on the couch.
Jack leans in for a kiss but is interrupted by the ominous
whir of a wheelchair. We see COLLEEN’S feet slowly enter
frame.
Jack!!!
COLLEEN (O.S.)
CUT BACK TO:
INT. JACK’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Jack, Elisa and Jonathan are as we left them.
JACK
Colleen has many prejudices:
Blacks, Jews, Scots, vegetarians,
the bearded. She has issues with
me dating a woman who’s, I’m sorry,
what do you call yourself?
ELISA
A Puerto Rican.
JACK
No, I know you can say that, but
what can people like me call you?
ELISA
Puerto Ricans.
JACK
Wow. That does not sound okay. I
get it though. When you’re working
for mother it’s all work. But you
are off tonight...
ELISA
Sorry, Jack. I’m
another patient.
Old man, advanced

Mr. Templeton.

That reminds me, I owe Lou Dobbs a
call. What about Friday?30 ROCK 308: "TBD"

ELISA
Mr. Templeton again. Saturday I
work for your mom. Sunday I visit
with my grandmother.
Monday?
JACK
JONATHAN
That’s my murder mystery party.
You still haven’t RSVP’d.
Jack glowers at him.
ELISA
Look, Jack, I know my schedule is
insane. But that’s my life. If at
any point you think I’m too much
trouble I’ll totally get it.
She kisses him and exits.
Jack is pensive for a silent beat.
JONATHAN
No one’s signed up to bring swiss
cheese fondu so --
Shut up.
JACK
CUT TO:
INT. STUDIO BACKSTAGE - A LITTLE LATER
Liz notices sick people everywhere.
KENNETH approaches.
KENNETH
Miss Lemon, Mr. Donaghy wants you
in the green room for a flu shot
ASAP.
LIZ
Wow, it’s hitting everyone. Until
you get your shot, be careful.
KENNETH
Oh, don’t worry about me. I’ve
never been sick a day in my life.
(whispers)
They say I’m “unbreakable.”
